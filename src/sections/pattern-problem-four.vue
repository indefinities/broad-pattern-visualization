<template>
  <section class="pattern-problem-four">
    <h2>Problem Four</h2>
    <p><em>resize screen for responsiveness for different screen sizes</em></p>
    <p>The only change I made was applying <code>display: flex;</code> as a style for the buttons for filtering the data</p>

<script>
export default {
